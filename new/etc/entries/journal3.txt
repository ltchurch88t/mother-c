Journal Entry: System Malfunction
Date: 2328-04-20

We have encountered a critical system malfunction that has put the entire ship at risk. It began with a series of unexpected power surges that caused several systems to go offline intermittently. Initially, we believed it was a minor issue, possibly due to a faulty component.

However, the problem escalated rapidly. The surges became more frequent, and we started experiencing complete system failures. Our diagnostic tools were unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the malfunction. It was as if the ship had a mind of its own, selectively shutting down different parts of the system.

The most concerning aspect is the failure of our life support systems. For a brief period, the oxygen levels began to drop, and we had to rely on emergency backups to stabilize the environment. The engineering team is working around the clock to identify and fix the issue.

We suspect that the alien technology we encountered may have something to do with this. It is possible that their presence or their technology has interfered with our systems. Alternatively, this could be a deliberate act of sabotage.

We are on high alert and have initiated a thorough investigation. All crew members have been instructed to report any unusual activity immediately. The safety of the ship and its crew is our top priority, and we will do everything in our power to resolve this crisis.
